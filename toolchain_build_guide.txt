if you do not want to compile toolchain by yourself, simply do:

sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib libopencm3

this installs about 2GB of files, while a manually compiled toolchain can be
about just 230mb. follow the steps beneath if you dont want 2GB files:

cd /tmp, download binutils and gcc source, extract them.
cd gcc-14.2.0 then do:

ln -s ../binutils-2.44/bfd bfd
ln -s ../binutils-2.44/binutils binutils
ln -s ../binutils-2.44/gas gas
ln -s ../binutils-2.44/ld ld
ln -s ../binutils-2.44/libctf libctf
ln -s ../binutils-2.44/opcodes opcodes

gcc's configure script can automatically detect them, so binutils can be
built together with gcc, no need build them separately.

also disable these libraries, as they are enabled by default but can't be
built for arm-none-eabi, simply rename their directory to disable them:

mv libquadmath _libquadmath
mv libssp _libssp

remember to create a build directory, never run configure script in project
root, this is demanded according to official gnu documentation:

mkdir build && ../configure --target=arm-none-eabi --enable-languages=c

and finally:

make -j<cpu_cores+1>
sudo make install-strip

install-strip! not bare 'install'.
install-strip is just about 200mb.
and install is over 1GB.

newlib build guide is not completed yet. if your project does not reference
newlib functions, it's ok to only use arm-none-eabi-gcc.
